Reordered many of the installations so that prerequisite modules are installed befor the modules thatdepend on them.

Added Digest::base and Digest::MD5.  These modules are not part of the "Phalanx 100", but are required by many of the modules on the list.

Implemented some changes sent in a patch by Jim Cromie.  The MySQL and Perl clarified a question on MySQL installs as well.
